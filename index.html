Smedley during his time in YMCA (Young Men‚Äôs Christian Association) in Bloomington, Illinois, as director of education at the YMCA, Smedley saw a need for the men in the community to learn how to verbalize, plan programs, conduct meetings, and work on committees, and he wanted to avail them.And hence decided to organize a club where they could learn these skills in a social environment, and the men responded well to the concept. He denominated the group the Toastmasters Club; ‚Äútoastmaster‚Äù was a popular term that referred to a person who gave toasts at banquets.

            <p>The Indian Government has set up the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) at NITI Aayog. Realizing the desideratum to engender scientific temper and cultivate the spirit of curiosity and innovation among puerile minds, AIM proposes to fortify the formulation of a network of Atal Tinkering Labs (ATL). NITI Aayog is inviting applications from schools to establish Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs) across India. ATL is a workspace where puerile minds can give shape to their conceptions by learning innovation skills through hands-on do-it-yourself mode. The vision is to ‚ÄúCultivate more than 1 million students in India as Neoteric Innovators‚Äù. Young children will get a chance to work with implements and equipment to understand the concepts of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math).ATL would contain edifying and learning kits and equipment on different fields like in science, robotics, electronics, sensors, open-source microcontroller boards, 3D printers, and computers. This would be a great opportunity for our school to give our students hands-on learning to foster ingenuity, and imagination in adolescent minds.
            The objective of this scheme is to inculcate skills such as computational thinking, design mind-set, physical computing, adaptive learning, etc. Puerile children (Classes 6-12) will get a chance to work with implements and equipment to understand what, how and why aspects of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math).One-time establishment cost of Rs.10 lakh and operational expenses of Rs.10 lakhs for a maximum period of 5 years to each ATL consumables, organizing popular science lecture series and other scientific activities.

Through intense coaching for various entrances, I got through SIBM (Symbiosis Institute Of Management Studies), Pune. It is a dream place to learn and transform as an individual.

Hi, this is Saurabh Chandak, of batch 2012-2013. I have been a part of Delhi Public School, Nacharam (DPS) for 7 years (6th to 12th Grade). It has been an absolute honour to be a part of such a prestigious school. It has moulded me into the person that I am today and has helped me achieve my goals. I am proud to say that I am a Chartered Accountant and I am working in a globally recognised Firm - Ernst & Young LLP, as a tax consultant. Being a student of DPS has taught me a lot, but most of all it has helped me inculcate & instil the right values that have guided me to the right path. I take this opportunity to thank my teachers, whose guidance has made my journey easier and fruitful. Insite of passing out, the teachers have always extended their support and given a helping hand to all those in need. The support and patience of our teachers is truly commendable. As a token of thanks, I hope and pray that I get an opportunity to repay the school one day for everything that it has taught me.

        <p class="p_modal">Growing up I never imagined I would settle down in the fashion industry until I chose fashion as my elective subject. Who knew this would be my main strength one day. I have applied to all the main colleges in India to make it big into this strength, but fortunately never cracked them. Yes, you read it right, I feel very fortunate to have never cracked them. If I did crack them I wouldn't be where I am today. it motivated me to only apply further and not degrade myself or settle for something lesser. I threw a stone into the lake, never expected I would actually get selected for ESMOD Paris. The most prestigious school with the most ancient techniques of fashion existing, that would make you no lesser than a perfectionist in this industry. I spent a year over there only to realize that was not meant for me, ESMOD was not my place. I moved on to IFA, in Paris for my second year. A new budding international school that had so much more to offer the student than ESMOD did. 2nd year in IFA was not an easy road. I was thinking ESMOD was the toughest but guess not. In a way I was very glad that IFA was going all rough and tough, it meant I would only be well prepared for the future. I won't say I have reached my success yet, but I can say I'm on the right road that will lead me to it one day. believing in your self when the whole world looks at you in a very peculiar way was the most difficult thing to do, but I realized if I was being looked upon as a peculiar person, it meant I'm doing something they are not, probably going to do something they did not expect either!.
